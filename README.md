# MOON

MOON is a web MIPS32 simulator, that can be easily acessed from any device with a browser.
It's inspired by [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/), with modern web technologies like [React](https://react.dev/), [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) and [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/)
